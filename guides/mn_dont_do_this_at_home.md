## Why setting up a MasterNode at home is a bad idea

Some people, including me at some point, want to save a few bucks and run a MasterNode at home on a retired PC or Laptop collecting dust. Good idea? **NO**

Here's why:

* The purpose of a MN is to be a highly available system that is reachable, has low network latency and high bandwidth. These are rarely found in the average home.

* Static IP addresses are also harder to get for residential users or they cost extra money.

* Even if you get a static IP, you need ninja sysadmin skills to get through all the firewalls a home network will have.

* Running old PCs and Laptops at home also costs energy, creates noise and they can be a fire risk when running 24/7.

* Your IP Address can be traced back to your home, therefore it is unsafe.


**Recommendation:** Get a $5 a month Linux VPS server and host up to four MasterNode from different coins.
